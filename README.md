# Account Library

A library to facilitate mapping between the RPC(client)-side user (`CordappUser`) and Corda identity (`AbstractParty`) in the smart contracts. It provides node-level user management workflows and utility flows and functions for defining domain-level workflows using client-side user identities.

The need for this mapping arises from the limitation that users of the smart contracts in certain applications do not operate full nodes. Then for the Cordapp developers, they need to think of other ways to represent the users on-chain. Corda's `account-sdk` can assist but its direct usage makes the smart contracts more difficult to write and interact poorly with smart contracts that do not involve accounts. In contrast, this library can let developers write smart contracts as if all users operate a full node with minimum adjustment.
